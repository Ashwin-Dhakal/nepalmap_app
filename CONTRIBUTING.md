# Contributing

You are free to contribute to Code4Nepal via GitHub Pull Requests. 

## Best practices
- Always do your best to ensure a good user experience
- Repeatability and consistency is important for reuse
- Prefer reuse over building from scratch
- Use pip to manage dependencies.
- Version your dependencies. Use pip freeze to save dependencies into a single requirements.txt file.
- Follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) as a python style guide so as to be consistent with other python libraries and tools.
- Use virtualenv to sandbox your projects.
- Never commit sensitive credentials or other information into the repo. If it happens accidentally, remove them from the source and change them.
- Sensitive data should be injected into the application through environment variables or some other mechanism that doesnâ€™t involve checking it into source control.
